# Customer Churn Model

## About the Project

This project aims to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) using historical customer behavior and interaction data. By leveraging data-driven insights, the model helps businesses identify customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive retention strategies and improved customer satisfaction.

## Technologies Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python (for data processing and modeling)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (commonly used in churn prediction projects)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pip (Python package installer)

You will also need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devanshu2005-ally/Customer_Churn_Model.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Customer_Churn_Model
   ```
3. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the main notebook file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
    - Load and explore the dataset
    - Perform data preprocessing
    - Train and evaluate the churn prediction model
    - Visualize the results
